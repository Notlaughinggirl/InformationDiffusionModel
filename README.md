Information Difussion Model
=========================

This program is used for paper "An Information Diffusion Model of Micro Public Good Based on Social Network", by Jun Wang, Dalu Zhang and Ran Xia, Sixth International Conference on Measuring Technology and Mechatronics Automation (ICMTMA), 2014.

The program is delevoped and tested on Eclipse.

Besides SDK from sina weibo, this program includes three packages: Spider, including functions to obtain sub-network adn information network from sina weibo social network; GetWeb, including functions to generate simulation network; Simulation, including functions to simulate the information difussion.

To run this program, you need to first follow the instructions and license from sina weibo to get sina weibo SDK, then download the jxl.jar, add it in the lib, then you can simply add the projects to Eclipse to run it.
